# TODO & Ideas

* Write a subroutine `display_grid()` that prints spaces instead of zeros.
* The formats to enter a puzzle manually or from a text file
  currently differs. A future version of the program could address this issue.
* A solver using a backtracking algorithm, that could find all solutions.
* Explore parallelization with DO CONCURRENT, coarrays or collective routines... Or OpenMP.
* Would OOP bring something? (without impeding performance?)
